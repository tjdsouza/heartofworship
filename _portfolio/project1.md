"I am so grateful to have met this wonderful, powerful, and anointed woman of God. Every time I'm around her she blesses me and messes up my eyelashes because I'm crying. She is full of the anointing and I'm so grateful to know her.

I remember the first time I went, I just wanted to see what this was all about not knowing when I got there this sista had a word for me. I had NEVER met her and she knew nothing about me so I know it came straight from GOD.

Every time she has a worship encounter I'm trying my best to be there, I feel like if I don't go, I'm going to miss something. The way I describe the worship encounters is a refill or extra dose of anointing because every time I leave the worship encounter and go minister, there's is a difference.

If you have never been please get with the program come and get an extra dose of anointing, it doesn't matter where she has the encounters: God always shows up and shows out, and I promise you won't leave the same way you came.

If you know that you are already blessed, come get an extra dose. If you know you are already anointed come get an extra dose.
Just come worship under the anointing.
God bless you, and I hope to see you there.

Jesus loves you!"

â€” Sara
