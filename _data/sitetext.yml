    title: "Meet Erykah!"
    text: "a dance minister's story"
    body: "Erykah Hall is a native of California that was actively involved in the liturgical dance community in the Central Valley. Beginning at the age of eight, she was invited to travel and minister at church services and worship arts conferences, driven by her love for God, passion for worship through movement and her desire to serve others. In 2021, Erykah relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio, to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Mental Health Counseling at the University of Cincinnati. She graduated in April 2023 and obtained her Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) licensure.Since her relocation, Erykah has been instrumental in unifying and revitalizing the dance ministry in the Cincinnati area, connecting with fellow dance ministers by facilitating workshops, spontaneous worship nights, and recitals in alignment with her God-given mission. In 2025, Erykah established Heart Of Worship, LLC, to spread the Gospel through movement and provide training for dance ministers in both biblical principles and technique, empowering them to serve effectively in the Kingdom of God. Erykah is both humbled and enthusiastic about witnessing the impact of Heart of Worship, and expresses her gratitude to all who have supported her throughout this journey."
